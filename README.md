# Notopia - A modern advanced note taking app
### An open-source, full-featured notes app inspired by Google Keep — built from scratch with performance, user experience, and design in mind.


## 🔍 Overview
- Notopia is a modern, advanced note-taking web app that replicates and improves upon the Google Keep experience. From custom-built drag-and-drop functionality to an optimized masonry layout, nearly every component has been handcrafted without relying on third-party libraries.

- This project is the result of nearly a year of work — focused on creating a smooth, fast, and user-friendly interface backed by solid architecture and real user feedback.
